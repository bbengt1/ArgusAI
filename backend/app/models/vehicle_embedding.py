"""VehicleEmbedding SQLAlchemy ORM model for vehicle-specific embeddings (Story P4-8.3)

Stores vehicle embeddings extracted from event thumbnails for vehicle recognition.
Each vehicle detected in an event thumbnail gets its own embedding record.

Attributes:
    id: UUID primary key
    event_id: Foreign key to events table (CASCADE delete)
    entity_id: Optional foreign key to recognized_entities (SET NULL on delete)
    embedding: JSON array of 512 floats (stored as Text for SQLite compatibility)
    bounding_box: JSON object with x, y, width, height
    confidence: Detection confidence score (0.0-1.0)
    vehicle_type: Detected vehicle type (car, truck, motorcycle, bus)
    model_version: Version string for the embedding model
    created_at: Timestamp when embedding was generated (UTC)

Privacy:
    - Vehicle embeddings are stored locally only
    - Users can delete individual or all vehicle embeddings
    - CASCADE delete ensures cleanup when events are deleted

    Vehicle embedding model for vehicle recognition.
